I build user-facing crypto applications and developer tooling — wallets, explorers, and smart-contract helpers. I focus on secure, auditable code and practical developer UX.

- 🔭 Currently focused on: modernizing Reef integrations and core SDKs
- 🌱 Learning: zk tooling, MEV-resistant UX, and secure key management
- 👯 Open to: collaboration on wallets, SDKs, infra tooling, and audits
- 💬 Ask me about: Solidity, Rust (WASM), TypeScript, Node.js, Postgres, Docker

## Contact & account notes
- Primary GitHub identity (verified): Scutua.tua@icloud.com  
- Designated asset receiver & public contact for cloud/GitHub: t.chaisak2518@outlook.com  
- Other linked addresses: Scutua@gmail.com, czonedive@gmail.com

(If you prefer only one contact email publicly visible, consider listing the asset receiver for outreach and keeping others private/verified for account recovery and commit identity.)

---

## Featured Projects

- [reef-legacy](https://github.com/scutuatua-crypto/reef-legacy) — Legacy Reef integrations, wallet adapters, and migration notes. Good candidate for a migration roadmap and compatibility tests.
- [Czonedive-core](https://github.com/scutuatua-crypto/Czonedive-core) — Core SDK and smart-contract utilities that power CZonedive. Add a Quickstart and API examples to lower onboarding friction.
- [scutuatua-crypto](https://github.com/scutuatua-crypto/scutuatua-crypto) — Profile repo and hub for links, blog posts, and your public notes.

(Replace links above with full URLs if any of the repos are under a different owner.)

---

## Tech & Skills
- Languages: Solidity, Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python  
- Tools & infra: Hardhat, Foundry, Node.js, Next.js, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis  
- Focus areas: secure wallet UX, auditing, SDK ergonomics, CI/CD for smart contracts

---

## Security & account tips
- Add all your emails to GitHub (Settings → Emails) and verify them. Use Scutua.tua@icloud.com as your verified primary identity.
- Use t.chaisak2518@outlook.com as the outreach/asset receiver email where you want to receive cloud/GitHub-related notifications and account recovery messages.
- Do not publish private keys, secrets, or .env values. If any secrets were accidentally committed, remove them and rotate immediately.

---

## Next recommended improvements
1. Pin the three featured projects on your GitHub profile.
2. Add README.md, LICENSE (MIT/Apache-2.0), and CONTRIBUTING.md to each repo.
3. Add GitHub Actions CI (tests + build) and add badges to each repo README.
4. Add repo topics (solidity, rust, typescript, web3, wallets).
5. Create a secure workflow for secrets (GitHub Secrets) and remove any accidental leaks with a history rewrite (BFG or git-filter-repo) if necessary.

---

## How to get in touch
- Prefer contact: t.chaisak2518@outlook.com  
- For account/identity: Scutua.tua@icloud.com

Thanks — if you want, I’ll generate README.md templates for each featured repo (quickstart, examples, badges) and produce the exact git commands to push them.
