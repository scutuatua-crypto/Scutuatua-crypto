    <abstract>
      <t>The DNSSEC protocol makes use of various cryptographic algorithms to provide
   authentication of DNS data and proof of nonexistence.  To ensure
   interoperability between DNS resolvers and DNS authoritative servers, it is
   necessary to specify both a set of algorithm implementation requirements and
   usage guidelines to ensure that there is at least one algorithm that all
   implementations support. This document replaces and obsoletes RFC 8624 and moves the
   canonical source of algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
   for DNSSEC from RFC 8624 to the IANA DNSSEC algorithm registries. This is done to allow
   the list of requirements to be more easily updated and referenced.
   Extensions to these registries can be made in future RFCs.
   This document also updates RFC 9157 and incorporates the revised 
      IANA DNSSEC considerations from that RFC.</t>
      
      <t>This document does not change the recommendation status (<bcp14>MUST</bcp14>, <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>, <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14>, etc.) 
   of the algorithms listed in RFC 8624; that is the work of future documents.</t>

    <section anchor="introduction">
      <name>Introduction</name>
      <t>"DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)" <xref target="RFC9364"/> is used to provide
   authentication of DNS data. The DNSSEC signing algorithms are
   defined by various RFCs, including <xref target="RFC4034"/>, <xref target="RFC4509"/>, <xref target="RFC5155"/>,
   <xref target="RFC5702"/>, <xref target="RFC5933"/>, <xref target="RFC6605"/>, and <xref target="RFC8080"/>.</t>
      <t>To ensure interoperability, a set of "mandatory-to-implement"
   DNS Public Key (DNSKEY) algorithms are defined in <xref target="RFC8624"/>.  To make the current
   status of the algorithms more easily accessible and understandable,
   and to make future changes to these recommendations easier to
   publish, this document moves the canonical status of the algorithms
   from <xref target="RFC8624"/> to the IANA DNSSEC algorithm registries.
This document also incorporates 
   the revised IANA DNSSEC considerations from <xref target="RFC9157"/>.
   Additionally, as advice to operators, it adds recommendations for
   deploying and using these algorithms.</t>
      <t>This is similar to the process used for the "TLS Cipher Suites" registry <xref target="TLS-ciphersuites"/>,
  where the canonical list of cipher suites is in the IANA registry, and
  RFCs reference the IANA registry.</t>
      <section anchor="document-audience">

        <t>The columns added to the IANA <xref target="DNSKEY-IANA">"DNS Security Algorithm Numbers"</xref>
   and <xref target="DS-IANA">"Digest Algorithms"</xref> registries target DNSSEC operators and implementers.</t>
        <t>Implementations need to meet high security expectations as
   well as provide interoperability between various implementations and with
   different versions.</t>
        <t>The field of cryptography evolves continuously.  New, stronger algorithms
   appear, and existing algorithms may be found to be less secure than
   originally thought.  Therefore, algorithm implementation requirements and
   usage guidance need to be updated from time to time in order to reflect the
   new reality and to allow for a smooth transition to more secure algorithms
   as well as the deprecation of algorithms deemed to no longer be secure.</t>
        <t>Implementations need to be conservative in the selection of
   algorithms they implement in order to minimize both code complexity
   and the  attack surface.</t>
        <t>The perspective of implementers may differ from that of an operator
   who wishes to deploy and configure DNSSEC with only the safest
   algorithm.  As such, this document also adds new recommendations
   about which algorithms should be deployed regardless of
   implementation status. In general, it is expected that deployment
   of aging algorithms should generally be reduced before
   implementations stop supporting them.</t>

      <section anchor="updating-algorithm-requirement-levels">
        <name>Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels</name>
        <t>By the time a DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is made
   mandatory to implement, it should already be available in most
   implementations.  This document defines an IANA registration
   modification to allow future documents to specify the
   implementation recommendations for each algorithm, as the
   recommendation status of each DNSSEC cryptographic algorithm is
   expected to change over time.  For example, there is no guarantee
   that newly introduced algorithms will become mandatory to implement
   in the future.  Likewise, published algorithms are continuously
   subjected to cryptographic attack and may become too weak, or even
   be completely broken, and will require deprecation in the future.</t>
        <t>It is expected that the deprecation of an algorithm will be performed
   gradually.  This provides time for implementations to update
   their implemented algorithms while remaining interoperable.  Unless
   there are strong security reasons, an algorithm is expected to be
   downgraded from <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> to <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> or <bcp14>MAY</bcp14>, instead of directly
   from <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> to <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>.  Similarly, an algorithm that has not been
   mentioned as mandatory to implement is expected to be first introduced
   as <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> instead of a <bcp14>MUST</bcp14>.</t>
        <t>Since the effect of using an unknown DNSKEY algorithm is that the
   zone is treated as insecure, it is recommended that algorithms
   that have been downgraded to <bcp14>NOT RECOMMENDED</bcp14> or lower not be used
   by authoritative nameservers and DNSSEC signers to create new
   DNSKEYs.  This ensures that the use of deprecated algorithms
   decreases over time.  Once an algorithm has reached a sufficiently
   low level of deployment, it can be marked as <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>, so that
   recursive resolvers can remove support for validating it.</t>
        <t>Validating recursive resolvers are encouraged to retain support for all
   algorithms not marked as <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14>.</t>

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>The security of cryptographic systems depends on the strength of
   both the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the keys used
   with those algorithms.  The security also depends on the engineering
   of the protocol used by the system to ensure that there are no non-
   cryptographic ways to bypass the security of the overall system.</t>
      <t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic algorithms
   for the use of DNSSEC, specifically with the selection of
   "mandatory-to-implement" algorithms.  In this document, the algorithms identified as <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> or <bcp14>RECOMMENDED</bcp14> to implement are not known to be broken at
   the current time, and cryptographic research so far leads us to believe that
   they are likely to remain adequately secure unless significant and
   unexpected discovery is made. However, this isn't necessarily forever, and
   it is expected that future documents will be issued from time to time to
   reflect the current best practices in this area.</t>
      <t>Retiring an algorithm too soon would result in a zone signed with
   the retired algorithm being downgraded to the equivalent of an
   unsigned zone.  Therefore, algorithm deprecation must be done only
   after careful consideration and ideally slowly when possible.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="operational-considerations">
      <name>Operational Considerations</name>
      <t>DNSKEY algorithm rollover in a live zone is a complex process.  See
   <xref target="RFC6781"/> and <xref target="RFC7583"/> for guidelines on how to perform algorithm
   rollovers.</t>
      <t>DS algorithm rollover in a live zone is also a complex process.
   Upgrading an algorithm at the same time as rolling to the new Key
   Signing Key (KSK) key will lead to DNSSEC validation failures, and
   users <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> upgrade the DS algorithm first before rolling to a new
   KSK.</t>
